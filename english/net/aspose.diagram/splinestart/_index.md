## SplineStart class

Contains x- and y-coordinates for a spline's second control point, its second knot, its first knot, the last knot, and the degree of the spline. This information is contained in the X, Y, A, B, C, and D elements, respectively.

```csharp
public class SplineStart : Coordinate
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [SplineStart](splinestart)() | Creates an instance of [`SplineStart`](../splinestart) class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [A](../../aspose.diagram/splinestart/a) { get; set; } | The second knot of the spline. |
| [B](../../aspose.diagram/splinestart/b) { get; set; } | The first knot of a spline. |
| [C](../../aspose.diagram/splinestart/c) { get; set; } | The last knot of the spline. |
| [D](../../aspose.diagram/splinestart/d) { get; set; } | The degree of the spline (an integer from 1 to 25). |
| override [Del](../../aspose.diagram/splinestart/del) { get; set; } | A flag indicating whether the element has been deleted locally. A value of 1 indicates that the element was deleted locally. |
| override [IX](../../aspose.diagram/splinestart/ix) { get; set; } | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |
| [X](../../aspose.diagram/splinestart/x) { get; set; } | The x-coordinate of a spline's second control point. |
| [Y](../../aspose.diagram/splinestart/y) { get; set; } | The y-coordinate of a spline's second control point. |
