## Control class

Contains elements for the x- and y-coordinates of each control handle defined for a shape, and elements that specify the way the control handle should behave.

```csharp
public class Control : ICloneable
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Control](control)() | Constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CanGlue](../../aspose.diagram/control/canglue) { get; set; } | Determines whether a control handle can be glued to other shapes. |
| [Del](../../aspose.diagram/control/del) { get; set; } | A flag indicating whether the element has been deleted locally. A value of 1 indicates that the element was deleted locally. |
| [ID](../../aspose.diagram/control/id) { get; set; } | The unique ID of the element within its parent element. |
| [IX](../../aspose.diagram/control/ix) { get; set; } | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |
| [Name](../../aspose.diagram/control/name) { get; set; } | The name of the element. |
| [NameU](../../aspose.diagram/control/nameu) { get; set; } | The universal name of the element. |
| [Prompt](../../aspose.diagram/control/prompt) { get; set; } | Prompt element specifies descriptive text that appears as a tool tip when the mouse pointer is paused over a shape's control handle. |
| [X](../../aspose.diagram/control/x) { get; set; } | The x-coordinate that indicates the location of a shape's control handle. |
| [XCon](../../aspose.diagram/control/xcon) { get; set; } | Specifies the type of behavior the x-coordinate of the control handle exhibits after the handle is moved. |
| [XDyn](../../aspose.diagram/control/xdyn) { get; set; } | Specifies the x-coordinate for a control handle's anchor point in local coordinates. The anchor point is used for rubber-banding during dynamics. |
| [Y](../../aspose.diagram/control/y) { get; set; } | The y-coordinate that indicates the location of a shape's control handle. |
| [YCon](../../aspose.diagram/control/ycon) { get; set; } | Specifies the type of behavior the x-coordinate of the control handle exhibits after the handle is moved. |
| [YDyn](../../aspose.diagram/control/ydyn) { get; set; } | Specifies the y-coordinate for a control handle's anchor point in local coordinates. The anchor point is used for rubber-banding during dynamics. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
