## GluedShapesFlags enumeration

Specifies constants that identify which shapes to return, based on the dimensionality and directionality of the connection points that are glued to a particular shape; passed to the Shape.GluedShapes method.

```csharp
public enum GluedShapesFlags
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GluedShapesAll1D | `0` | Return IDs of all 1-D shapes that are glued to this shape. |
| GluedShapesIncoming1D | `1` | Return IDs of 1-D shapes whose end points are glued to this shape. |
| GluedShapesOutgoing1D | `2` | Return IDs of 1-D shapes whose begin points are glued to this shape. |
| GluedShapesAll2D | `3` | Return all 2-D shapes that are glued to this shape and all 2-D shapes to which this shape is glued. |
| GluedShapesIncoming2D | `4` | If the source object is a 1-D shape, return IDs of 2-D shape to which the begin point is glued. If the source object is a 2-D shape, return IDs of 2-D shapes that are glued to this shape. |
| GluedShapesOutgoing2D | `5` | If the source object is a 1-D shape, return IDs of 2-D shape to which the end point is glued. If the source object is a 2-D shape, return IDs of 2-D shapes to which this shape is glued. |
