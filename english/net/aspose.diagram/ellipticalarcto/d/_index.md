## EllipticalArcTo.D property

The ratio of an arc's major axis to its minor axis. Despite the usual meaning of these words, the major axis does not have to be greater than the minor axis, so this ratio does not have to be greater than 1. Setting this element to a value less than or equal to 0 or greater than 1000 can lead to unpredictable results.

```csharp
public DoubleValue D { get; set; }
