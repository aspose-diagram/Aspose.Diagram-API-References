## Misc class

Contains various elements of shapes and groups, such as those that control selection highlighting and visibility.

```csharp
public class Misc
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [BegTrigger](../../aspose.diagram/misc/begtrigger) { get; } | Contains a trigger formula generated by Microsoft Visio that determines whether to move the begin point of a 1-D shape to maintain its connection to another shape. |
| [Calendar](../../aspose.diagram/misc/calendar) { get; } | Determines the calendar that is used for custom properties, text fields, and element formulas. |
| [Comment](../../aspose.diagram/misc/comment) { get; } | Contains the comment text in string format for a shape. |
| [Del](../../aspose.diagram/misc/del) { get; set; } | A flag indicating whether the element has been deleted locally. A value of 1 indicates that the element was deleted locally. |
| [DropOnPageScale](../../aspose.diagram/misc/droponpagescale) { get; } | Determines the percentage by which a shape is scaled when it is dropped on the drawing page. |
| [DynFeedback](../../aspose.diagram/misc/dynfeedback) { get; } | Specifies the type of visual feedback provided to users when they drag a connector |
| [EndTrigger](../../aspose.diagram/misc/endtrigger) { get; } | Contains a trigger formula generated by Microsoft Visio. This trigger formula determines whether to move the end point of a 1-D shape to maintain its connection to another shape. |
| [GlueType](../../aspose.diagram/misc/gluetype) { get; } | Specifies whether dynamic (shape-to-shape) glue is allowed when connecting to a shape |
| [HideText](../../aspose.diagram/misc/hidetext) { get; } | Hides the text for a shape. You can view text, edit properties, and apply styles to the text in the text block, although the changes will not appear until you specify the HideText element as 0. |
| [IsDropSource](../../aspose.diagram/misc/isdropsource) { get; } | Specifies whether the shape can be added to a group by dropping it onto the group |
| [IsReplaceLockShapeData](../../aspose.diagram/misc/isreplacelockshapedata) { get; } | Indicates whether the values of specified cells in a master shape overwrite the values (including local values) of a shape being replaced during a shape replacement operation. |
| [LangID](../../aspose.diagram/misc/langid) { get; } | Indicates the locale ID (LCID) of the language in which the cell formula, text, custom property, or comment was entered. |
| [LocalizeMerge](../../aspose.diagram/misc/localizemerge) { get; } | Determines whether shapes are localized (whether their LangIDelement is reset) when they are copied between documents. |
| [NoAlignBox](../../aspose.diagram/misc/noalignbox) { get; } | Specifies whether the selection rectangle is displayed when the shape is selected. |
| [NoCtlHandles](../../aspose.diagram/misc/noctlhandles) { get; } | Specifies whether control handles are displayed when the shape is selected. |
| [NoLiveDynamics](../../aspose.diagram/misc/nolivedynamics) { get; } | Specifies whether a shape dynamically resizes or rotates as the user manipulates it. |
| [NonPrinting](../../aspose.diagram/misc/nonprinting) { get; } | Specifies whether a selected shape can be printed. |
| [NoObjHandles](../../aspose.diagram/misc/noobjhandles) { get; } | Specifies whether selection handles are displayed when the shape is selected. |
| [ObjType](../../aspose.diagram/misc/objtype) { get; } | Specifies whether objects are placeable or routable in diagrams when you use Microsoft Visio to lay out shapes on the drawing page. |
| [ShapeKeywords](../../aspose.diagram/misc/shapekeywords) { get; } | Contains search keywords that have been assigned to custom master shapes. |
| [UpdateAlignBox](../../aspose.diagram/misc/updatealignbox) { get; } | Specifies whether to recalculate a shape's selection rectangle whenever a control handle is moved. |
| [WalkPreference](../../aspose.diagram/misc/walkpreference) { get; } | Specifies whether an endpoint of a 1-D shape moves to a horizontal or vertical connection point on the shape it is glued to, using dynamic glue, when the shape is moved to an ambiguous position. |
