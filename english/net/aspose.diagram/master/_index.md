## Master class

Contains elements that define a master for the document. A master is a shape on a stencil that you use repeatedly to create drawings. When you drag a shape from a stencil onto the drawing page, the shape becomes an instance of that master, and a local copy of the master is included in the document.

```csharp
public class Master : IDisposable
```

| [Master](master)() | Constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AlignName](../../aspose.diagram/master/alignname) { get; set; } | Specifies whether the master's text in the stencil window is aligned left, right, or center. |
| [BaseID](../../aspose.diagram/master/baseid) { get; set; } | A GUID (globally unique identifier) that identifies the master across documents. |
| [Connects](../../aspose.diagram/master/connects) { get; } | Contains a Connect element for each connection between two shapes in a drawing. |
| [Hidden](../../aspose.diagram/master/hidden) { get; set; } | Specifies whether the master is hidden in the user interface. |
| [Icon](../../aspose.diagram/master/icon) { get; set; } | Specifies a MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) encoded binary icon (in .ico format) for a Master or MasterShortcut element in a document. |
| [IconSize](../../aspose.diagram/master/iconsize) { get; set; } | The size of the element's icon. |
| [IconUpdate](../../aspose.diagram/master/iconupdate) { get; set; } | Specifies whether the icon is automatically generated from the master itself. |
| [ID](../../aspose.diagram/master/id) { get; set; } | The unique ID of the element within its parent element. |
| [MatchByName](../../aspose.diagram/master/matchbyname) { get; set; } | The MatchByName attribute determines how Microsoft Visio decides if a document master is already present when an instance of a master is dropped on the drawing page. It allows changes made to a document master to apply to new instances of the master, even if the instances are dragged from a stand-alone stencil file. |
| [Name](../../aspose.diagram/master/name) { get; set; } | The name of the element. |
| [NameU](../../aspose.diagram/master/nameu) { get; set; } | The universal name of the element. |
| [PageSheet](../../aspose.diagram/master/pagesheet) { get; } | Contains elements that define the page sheet for a Page or Master element. |
| [PatternFlags](../../aspose.diagram/master/patternflags) { get; set; } | The PatternFlags attribute determines whether a master behaves as a custom pattern. |
| [Prompt](../../aspose.diagram/master/prompt) { get; set; } | The status bar and tool tip prompt for the element. |
| [Shapes](../../aspose.diagram/master/shapes) { get; } | Collection of Shape objects. |
| [UniqueID](../../aspose.diagram/master/uniqueid) { get; set; } | A GUID that identifies the master within the document. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Clone](../../aspose.diagram/master/clone)() | Creates deep copy of this instance. |
| [Dispose](../../aspose.diagram/master/dispose)() | Performs application-defined tasks associated with freeing, releasing, or resetting unmanaged resources. |
