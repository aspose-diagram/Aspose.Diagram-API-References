## Master class

Contains elements that define a master for the document. A master is a shape on a stencil that you use repeatedly to create drawings. When you drag a shape from a stencil onto the drawing page, the shape becomes an instance of that master, and a local copy of the master is included in the document.

```csharp
public class Master : IDisposable
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Master](master)() | Constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AlignName](alignname) { get; set; } | Specifies whether the master's text in the stencil window is aligned left, right, or center. |
| [BaseID](baseid) { get; set; } | A GUID (globally unique identifier) that identifies the master across documents. |
| [Connects](connects) { get; } | Contains a Connect element for each connection between two shapes in a drawing. |
| [Hidden](hidden) { get; set; } | Specifies whether the master is hidden in the user interface. |
| [Icon](icon) { get; set; } | Specifies a MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) encoded binary icon (in .ico format) for a Master or MasterShortcut element in a document. |
| [IconSize](iconsize) { get; set; } | The size of the element's icon. |
| [IconUpdate](iconupdate) { get; set; } | Specifies whether the icon is automatically generated from the master itself. |
| [ID](id) { get; set; } | The unique ID of the element within its parent element. |
| [MatchByName](matchbyname) { get; set; } | The MatchByName attribute determines how Microsoft Visio decides if a document master is already present when an instance of a master is dropped on the drawing page. It allows changes made to a document master to apply to new instances of the master, even if the instances are dragged from a stand-alone stencil file. |
| [Name](name) { get; set; } | The name of the element. |
| [NameU](nameu) { get; set; } | The universal name of the element. |

| [Prompt](prompt) { get; set; } | The status bar and tool tip prompt for the element. |
| [Shapes](shapes) { get; } | Collection of Shape objects. |
| [UniqueID](uniqueid) { get; set; } | A GUID that identifies the master within the document. |
