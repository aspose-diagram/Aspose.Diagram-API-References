## InfiniteLine class

Contains elements specifying the x- and y-coordinates of two points on an infinite line. The X and Y elements specify the x- and y-coordinates of the first point, and the A and B elements specify the x- and y-coordinates of the second point.

```csharp
public class InfiniteLine : Coordinate
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [InfiniteLine](infiniteline)() | Creates an instance of the [`InfiniteLine`](../infiniteline) class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [A](../../aspose.diagram/infiniteline/a) { get; set; } | An x-coordinate of a point on the infinite line paired with the y-coordinate represented by the B element. |
| [B](../../aspose.diagram/infiniteline/b) { get; set; } | A y-coordinate of a point on an infinite line paired with an x-coordinate represented by the A element. |
| override [Del](../../aspose.diagram/infiniteline/del) { get; set; } | A flag indicating whether the element has been deleted locally. A value of 1 indicates that the element was deleted locally. |
| override [IX](../../aspose.diagram/infiniteline/ix) { get; set; } | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |
| [X](../../aspose.diagram/infiniteline/x) { get; set; } | An x-coordinate of a point on the infinite line. |
| [Y](../../aspose.diagram/infiniteline/y) { get; set; } | A y-coordinate of a point on the infinite line. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
