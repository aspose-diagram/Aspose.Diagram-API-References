## Ellipse class

Contains elements specifying the x- and y-coordinates of the ellipse's center point and two points on the ellipse.

```csharp
public class Ellipse : Coordinate
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Ellipse](ellipse)() | Creates an instance of the [`Ellipse`](../ellipse) class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [A](../../aspose.diagram/ellipse/a) { get; set; } | An x-coordinate of a point on the ellipse paired with the y-coordinate represented by the B element. |
| [B](../../aspose.diagram/ellipse/b) { get; set; } | A y-coordinate of a point on an ellipse paired with an x-coordinate represented by the A element. |
| [C](../../aspose.diagram/ellipse/c) { get; set; } | An x-coordinate of a point on the ellipse paired with y-coordinate represented by the D element. |
| [D](../../aspose.diagram/ellipse/d) { get; set; } | A y-coordinate of a point on the ellipse paired with x-coordinate represented by the C element. |
| override [Del](../../aspose.diagram/ellipse/del) { get; set; } | A flag indicating whether the element has been deleted locally. A value of 1 indicates that the element was deleted locally. |
| override [IX](../../aspose.diagram/ellipse/ix) { get; set; } | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |
| [X](../../aspose.diagram/ellipse/x) { get; set; } | The x-coordinate of the center of the ellipse. |
| [Y](../../aspose.diagram/ellipse/y) { get; set; } | The y-coordinate of the center of the ellipse. |

## Methods
