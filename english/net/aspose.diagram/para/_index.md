## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Bullet](../../aspose.diagram/para/bullet) { get; set; } | Determines the bullet style. |
| [BulletFont](../../aspose.diagram/para/bulletfont) { get; set; } | Represents the number of the font used to format the text when a custom bullet string is specified and the value in the Bullet element is non-zero. |
| [BulletFontSize](../../aspose.diagram/para/bulletfontsize) { get; set; } | Specifies the size of a bullet. |
| [BulletStr](../../aspose.diagram/para/bulletstr) { get; set; } | "Used to create a custom bullet style. Enter the style as a string (within quotation marks). For example, you could enter the string, ""ooo.""" |
| [Del](../../aspose.diagram/para/del) { get; set; } | A flag indicating whether the element has been deleted locally. A value of 1 indicates that the element was deleted locally. |
| [Flags](../../aspose.diagram/para/flags) { get; set; } | Indicates whether the text direction is left to right or right to left. |
| [HorzAlign](../../aspose.diagram/para/horzalign) { get; set; } | Specifies the horizontal alignment of text in the shape's text block. |
| [IndFirst](../../aspose.diagram/para/indfirst) { get; set; } | Specifies the distance the first line of each paragraph in the shape's text block is indented from the left indent of the paragraph. This value is independent of the scale of the drawing. If the drawing is scaled, the first line indent remains the same. |
| [IndLeft](../../aspose.diagram/para/indleft) { get; set; } | Specifies the distance all lines of text in a paragraph are indented from the left margin of the text block. This value is independent of the scale of the drawing. If the drawing is scaled, the left indent remains the same. |
| [IndRight](../../aspose.diagram/para/indright) { get; set; } | Specifies the distance all lines of text in a paragraph are indented from the right margin of the text block. This value is independent of the scale of the drawing. If the drawing is scaled, the right indent remains the same. |
| [IX](../../aspose.diagram/para/ix) { get; set; } | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |
| [LocalizeBulletFont](../../aspose.diagram/para/localizebulletfont) { get; set; } | Specifies whether the bullet font should be localized (translated into another language). |
| [SpAfter](../../aspose.diagram/para/spafter) { get; set; } | Specifies the amount of space inserted after each paragraph in the shape's text block. |
| [SpBefore](../../aspose.diagram/para/spbefore) { get; set; } | Specifies the amount of space inserted before each paragraph in the shape's text block. |
| [SpLine](../../aspose.diagram/para/spline) { get; set; } | Specifies the distance between one line of text and the next, where 100% is the height of a text line. |
| [TextPosAfterBullet](../../aspose.diagram/para/textposafterbullet) { get; set; } | Represents the distance between the first line of the paragraph and the bullet. |
