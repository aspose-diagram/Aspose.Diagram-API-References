| [FillBkgndTrans](fillbkgndtrans) { get; set; } | Specifies the transparency level for the background (fill) color of the shape's fill pattern, from 0 (completely opaque) to 1 (completely transparent). |
| [FillForegnd](fillforegnd) { get; set; } | Specifies the color used for the foreground (stroke) of the shape's fill pattern. |
| [FillForegndTrans](fillforegndtrans) { get; set; } | Specifies the transparency level for the foreground (fill) color of the shape's fill pattern, from 0 (completely opaque) to 1 (completely transparent). |
| [FillPattern](fillpattern) { get; set; } | Specifies the fill pattern for the shape. |
| [GradientFill](gradientfill) { get; } | Contains the current gradient fill formatting values for the shape |
| [ShapeShdwBlur](shapeshdwblur) { get; set; } | Specifies the shadow blur size of a shape. cannot draw blur now, but can parse from vsdx now. |

| [ShapeShdwOffsetX](shapeshdwoffsetx) { get; set; } | Determines the distance in page units that a shape's shadow is offset horizontally from the shape. |
| [ShapeShdwOffsetY](shapeshdwoffsety) { get; set; } | Determines the distance in page units that a shape's shadow is offset vertically from the shape. |
| [ShapeShdwScaleFactor](shapeshdwscalefactor) { get; set; } | Specifies the percentage by which the shadow of a shape can be enlarged or reduced. |
