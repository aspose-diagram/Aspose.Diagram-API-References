## Fill class

Contains the current fill formatting values for the shape and the shape's drop shadow, including pattern, foreground color, and background color.

```csharp
public class Fill : ICloneable
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Del](../../aspose.diagram/fill/del) { get; set; } | A flag indicating whether the element has been deleted locally. A value of 1 indicates that the element was deleted locally. |
| [FillBkgnd](../../aspose.diagram/fill/fillbkgnd) { get; set; } | Specifies the color used for the background of the shape's fill pattern. |
| [FillBkgndTrans](../../aspose.diagram/fill/fillbkgndtrans) { get; set; } | Specifies the transparency level for the background (fill) color of the shape's fill pattern, from 0 (completely opaque) to 1 (completely transparent). |
| [FillForegnd](../../aspose.diagram/fill/fillforegnd) { get; set; } | Specifies the color used for the foreground (stroke) of the shape's fill pattern. |
| [FillForegndTrans](../../aspose.diagram/fill/fillforegndtrans) { get; set; } | Specifies the transparency level for the foreground (fill) color of the shape's fill pattern, from 0 (completely opaque) to 1 (completely transparent). |
| [FillPattern](../../aspose.diagram/fill/fillpattern) { get; set; } | Specifies the fill pattern for the shape. |
| [GradientFill](../../aspose.diagram/fill/gradientfill) { get; } | Contains the current gradient fill formatting values for the shape |
| [ShapeShdwBlur](../../aspose.diagram/fill/shapeshdwblur) { get; set; } | Specifies the shadow blur size of a shape. cannot draw blur now, but can parse from vsdx now. |
| [ShapeShdwObliqueAngle](../../aspose.diagram/fill/shapeshdwobliqueangle) { get; set; } | Specifies the angle of oblique direction of a shape's shadow. |
| [ShapeShdwOffsetX](../../aspose.diagram/fill/shapeshdwoffsetx) { get; set; } | Determines the distance in page units that a shape's shadow is offset horizontally from the shape. |
| [ShapeShdwOffsetY](../../aspose.diagram/fill/shapeshdwoffsety) { get; set; } | Determines the distance in page units that a shape's shadow is offset vertically from the shape. |
| [ShapeShdwScaleFactor](../../aspose.diagram/fill/shapeshdwscalefactor) { get; set; } | Specifies the percentage by which the shadow of a shape can be enlarged or reduced. |
| [ShapeShdwShow](../../aspose.diagram/fill/shapeshdwshow) { get; set; } | Specifies the type of shadow for a shape. |
| [ShapeShdwType](../../aspose.diagram/fill/shapeshdwtype) { get; set; } | Specifies the type of shadow for a shape. |
| [ShdwBkgnd](../../aspose.diagram/fill/shdwbkgnd) { get; set; } | Specifies the color used for the background (fill) of the shape's drop shadow fill pattern. |
| [ShdwBkgndTrans](../../aspose.diagram/fill/shdwbkgndtrans) { get; set; } | Specifies transparency level for the background (fill) of the shape's drop shadow fill pattern, from 0.0 (completely opaque) to 1.0 (completely transparent). |
| [ShdwForegnd](../../aspose.diagram/fill/shdwforegnd) { get; set; } | Specifies the color used for the foreground (stroke) of the shape's drop shadow fill pattern. |
| [ShdwForegndTrans](../../aspose.diagram/fill/shdwforegndtrans) { get; set; } | Specifies transparency level for the foreground (stroke) of the shape's drop shadow fill pattern, from 0.0 (completely opaque) to 1.0 (completely transparent). |
| [ShdwPattern](../../aspose.diagram/fill/shdwpattern) { get; set; } | Specifies the fill pattern for a shape's shadow. |
