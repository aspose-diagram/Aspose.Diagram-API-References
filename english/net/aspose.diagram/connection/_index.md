## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AutoGen](../../aspose.diagram/connection/autogen) { get; } | Specifies if the connection point is generated automatically. A value of 1 indicates that the connection point is generated automatically. |
| [Del](../../aspose.diagram/connection/del) { get; set; } | A flag indicating whether the element has been deleted locally. A value of 1 indicates that the element was deleted locally. |
| [DirX](../../aspose.diagram/connection/dirx) { get; } | Specifies the x-component for the required alignment vector of a matching connection point. The DirX element is also used to orient the attached leg of a dynamic connector. |
| [DirY](../../aspose.diagram/connection/diry) { get; } | Specifies the y-component for the required alignment vector of a matching connection point. The DirY element is also used to orient the attached leg of a dynamic connector. |
| [ID](../../aspose.diagram/connection/id) { get; set; } | The unique ID of the element within its parent element. |
| [IX](../../aspose.diagram/connection/ix) { get; set; } | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |
| [Name](../../aspose.diagram/connection/name) { get; set; } | The name of the element. |
| [NameU](../../aspose.diagram/connection/nameu) { get; set; } | The universal name of the element. |
| [Prompt](../../aspose.diagram/connection/prompt) { get; } | Contains varying prompt information, based on the element in which it is contained. |
| [Type](../../aspose.diagram/connection/type) { get; } | Specifies various types, based on the element in which it is contained. |
| [X](../../aspose.diagram/connection/x) { get; } | Specifies an x-coordinate on a shape in local coordinates. |
| [Y](../../aspose.diagram/connection/y) { get; } | Specifies a y-coordinate on a shape in local coordinates. Local coordinates are those whose frame of reference is the shape, instead of the page. |
