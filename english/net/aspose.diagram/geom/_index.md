Contains elements that specify the coordinates of the vertices for the lines and arcs that make up the shape. If the shape has more than one path, there is a Geom element for each path.

```csharp
public class Geom : ICloneable
```

| [Geom](geom)() | Constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CoordinateCol](../../aspose.diagram/geom/coordinatecol) { get; } | Collection of coordinates. It shows sequence of coordinates. |
| [Del](../../aspose.diagram/geom/del) { get; set; } | A flag indicating whether the element has been deleted locally. A value of 1 indicates that the element was deleted locally. |
| [IX](../../aspose.diagram/geom/ix) { get; set; } | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |
| [NextCoordinateIX](../../aspose.diagram/geom/nextcoordinateix) { get; } | Returns IX value for next shape's coordinate collection member. |
| [NoFill](../../aspose.diagram/geom/nofill) { get; set; } | Specifies whether a path can be filled. |
| [NoLine](../../aspose.diagram/geom/noline) { get; set; } | Specifies whether a line is drawn around the boundary of the path. |
| [NoQuickDrag](../../aspose.diagram/geom/noquickdrag) { get; set; } | Determines whether a shape can be selected or dragged when the user clicks the filled area defined by the Geometry section. |
| [NoShow](../../aspose.diagram/geom/noshow) { get; set; } | Specifies whether a path is displayed on the drawing page. |
| [NoSnap](../../aspose.diagram/geom/nosnap) { get; set; } | Specifies whether other shapes snap to a path. |
