## TextBlock class

Contains elements that specify the alignment, margins, and default tab stop positions of text in a shape's text block.

```csharp
public class TextBlock : ICloneable
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [BottomMargin](bottommargin) { get; set; } | Determines the distance between the bottom border of the text block and the last line of text it contains. The default is 4 pt. This value is independent of the scale of the drawing. If the drawing is scaled, the bottom margin remains the same. |
| [DefaultTabStop](defaulttabstop) { get; set; } | Specifies the interval of the default tab stops in a text block. |

| [RightMargin](rightmargin) { get; set; } | Specifies the distance between the right border of the text block and the text it contains. This value is independent of the scale of the drawing. If the drawing is scaled, the right margin remains the same. |

| [TextBkgndTrans](textbkgndtrans) { get; set; } | Specifies the transparency level for the background color of a shape's text block, from 0 (completely opaque) to 1 (completely transparent). |
