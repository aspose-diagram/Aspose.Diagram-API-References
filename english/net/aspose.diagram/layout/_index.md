## Layout class

Contains elements that control shape placement and connector routing settings.

```csharp
public class Layout
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ConFixedCode](../../aspose.diagram/layout/confixedcode) { get; } | Determines when a connector reroutes. |
| [ConLineJumpCode](../../aspose.diagram/layout/conlinejumpcode) { get; } | Determines whether a connector jumps when two connectors cross, |
| [ConLineJumpDirX](../../aspose.diagram/layout/conlinejumpdirx) { get; } | Determines the line jump direction for line jumps occurring on a horizontal segment of a dynamic connector. |
| [ConLineJumpDirY](../../aspose.diagram/layout/conlinejumpdiry) { get; } | Determines the line jump direction for line jumps occurring on a vertical segment of a dynamic connector. |
| [ConLineJumpStyle](../../aspose.diagram/layout/conlinejumpstyle) { get; } | Determines the line jump style for line jumps on a dynamic connector. |
| [ConLineRouteExt](../../aspose.diagram/layout/conlinerouteext) { get; } | Determines the appearance of a connector. |
| [Del](../../aspose.diagram/layout/del) { get; set; } | A flag indicating whether the element has been deleted locally. A value of 1 indicates that the element was deleted locally. |
| [DisplayLevel](../../aspose.diagram/layout/displaylevel) { get; } | Determines the display level band (the relative range of Z-order grouping) for the shape. |
| [Relationships](../../aspose.diagram/layout/relationships) { get; } | Stores the relationships between containers, lists, callouts, and shapes. |
| [ShapeFixedCode](../../aspose.diagram/layout/shapefixedcode) { get; } | Specifies placement behavior for a placeable shape. |
| [ShapePermeablePlace](../../aspose.diagram/layout/shapepermeableplace) { get; } | Specifies whether placeable shapes can be placed on top of a shape when a user selects Lay Out Shapes (Shapes menu). |
| [ShapePermeableX](../../aspose.diagram/layout/shapepermeablex) { get; } | Specifies whether a connector can route horizontally through a shape. |
| [ShapePermeableY](../../aspose.diagram/layout/shapepermeabley) { get; } | Specifies whether a connector can route vertically through a shape. |
| [ShapePlaceFlip](../../aspose.diagram/layout/shapeplaceflip) { get; } | Specifies how a placeable shape flips and/or rotates on the page when a user selects Lay Out Shapes (Shapes menu). |
| [ShapePlaceStyle](../../aspose.diagram/layout/shapeplacestyle) { get; set; } | Determines the placement style for children. |
| [ShapePlowCode](../../aspose.diagram/layout/shapeplowcode) { get; } | Specifies whether a placeable shape moves away when you drag another placeable shape near the shape on the drawing page. |
| [ShapeRouteStyle](../../aspose.diagram/layout/shaperoutestyle) { get; } | Specifies the routing style and direction for a connector on the drawing page. |
| [ShapeSplit](../../aspose.diagram/layout/shapesplit) { get; } | Determines whether this shape can split shapes that are splittable. |
| [ShapeSplittable](../../aspose.diagram/layout/shapesplittable) { get; } | Determines whether this 1-D shape can be split. |
