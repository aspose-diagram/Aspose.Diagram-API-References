## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ConFixedCode](confixedcode) { get; } | Determines when a connector reroutes. |
| [ConLineJumpCode](conlinejumpcode) { get; } | Determines whether a connector jumps when two connectors cross, |
| [ConLineJumpDirX](conlinejumpdirx) { get; } | Determines the line jump direction for line jumps occurring on a horizontal segment of a dynamic connector. |
| [ConLineJumpDirY](conlinejumpdiry) { get; } | Determines the line jump direction for line jumps occurring on a vertical segment of a dynamic connector. |
| [ConLineJumpStyle](conlinejumpstyle) { get; } | Determines the line jump style for line jumps on a dynamic connector. |
| [ConLineRouteExt](conlinerouteext) { get; } | Determines the appearance of a connector. |
| [Del](del) { get; set; } | A flag indicating whether the element has been deleted locally. A value of 1 indicates that the element was deleted locally. |
| [DisplayLevel](displaylevel) { get; } | Determines the display level band (the relative range of Z-order grouping) for the shape. |
| [Relationships](relationships) { get; } | Stores the relationships between containers, lists, callouts, and shapes. |
| [ShapeFixedCode](shapefixedcode) { get; } | Specifies placement behavior for a placeable shape. |
| [ShapePermeablePlace](shapepermeableplace) { get; } | Specifies whether placeable shapes can be placed on top of a shape when a user selects Lay Out Shapes (Shapes menu). |
| [ShapePermeableX](shapepermeablex) { get; } | Specifies whether a connector can route horizontally through a shape. |
| [ShapePermeableY](shapepermeabley) { get; } | Specifies whether a connector can route vertically through a shape. |
| [ShapePlaceFlip](shapeplaceflip) { get; } | Specifies how a placeable shape flips and/or rotates on the page when a user selects Lay Out Shapes (Shapes menu). |
| [ShapePlaceStyle](shapeplacestyle) { get; set; } | Determines the placement style for children. |
| [ShapePlowCode](shapeplowcode) { get; } | Specifies whether a placeable shape moves away when you drag another placeable shape near the shape on the drawing page. |
| [ShapeRouteStyle](shaperoutestyle) { get; } | Specifies the routing style and direction for a connector on the drawing page. |
| [ShapeSplit](shapesplit) { get; } | Determines whether this shape can split shapes that are splittable. |
| [ShapeSplittable](shapesplittable) { get; } | Determines whether this 1-D shape can be split. |
