## UnitFormulaErrV.V property

Represents the null string condition for a string cell value. In some cases it is helpful to distinguish between an empty string cell null and a null string cell value. This attribute is used to distinguish between these forms of an empty value.

```csharp
public string V { get; set; }
```
