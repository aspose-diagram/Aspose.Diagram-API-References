## XForm class

Contains elements that control line attributes for a shape, such as pattern, weight, and color. These elements determine whether the line ends are formatted (for example, with an arrowhead), the size of line end formats, radius of the rounding circle applied to the line, and line cap style (round or square).

```csharp
public class XForm : ICloneable
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Angle](angle) { get; set; } | Represents the shape's current angle of rotation in relation to its parent. |
| [Del](del) { get; set; } | A flag indicating whether the element has been deleted locally. A value of 1 indicates that the element was deleted locally. |
| [FlipX](flipx) { get; set; } | Indicates whether the shape has been flipped horizontally |
| [FlipY](flipy) { get; set; } | Indicates whether the shape has been flipped vertically. |
| [Height](height) { get; set; } | Specifies the height of the shape in drawing units. |
| [LocPinX](locpinx) { get; set; } | Specifies the x-coordinate of the shape's pin (center of rotation) in relation to the origin of the shape. The default formula for determining LocPinX is: F='Width* 0.5'. |
| [LocPinY](locpiny) { get; set; } | Specifies the y-coordinate of the shape's pin (center of rotation) in relation to the origin of the shape. The default formula for determining LocPinY is: F='Height * 0.5'. |
| [PinPos](pinpos) { get; set; } | Specifies the pin position of the shape |
| [PinX](pinx) { get; set; } | Specifies the x-coordinate of the shape's pin (center of rotation) in relation to the origin of its parent. |
| [PinY](piny) { get; set; } | Specifies the y-coordinate of the shape's pin (center of rotation) in relation to the origin of its parent. |
| [ResizeMode](resizemode) { get; set; } | Specifies the current resize behavior setting for the shape when contained in a group. |
| [Width](width) { get; set; } | Contains the width of the associated shape in drawing units. |
