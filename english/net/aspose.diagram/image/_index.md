## Image class

Contains the gamma, brightness, contrast, blur, sharpen, denoise, and transparency values for a bitmap.

```csharp
public class Image
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Blur](../../aspose.diagram/image/blur/) { get; } | Blurs or softens a bitmap image. The Blur element contains a value between 0 and 1; the default value is 0. |
| [Brightness](../../aspose.diagram/image/brightness/) { get; } | Adjusts the brightness of a bitmap image. The Brightness element contains a value between 0 and 1; the default value is 0.5. |
| [Contrast](../../aspose.diagram/image/contrast/) { get; } | Specifies the contrast of a bitmap image. The Contrast element contains a value between 0 and 1. |
| [Del](../../aspose.diagram/image/del/) { get; set; } | A flag indicating whether the element has been deleted locally. A value of 1 indicates that the element was deleted locally. |
| [Denoise](../../aspose.diagram/image/denoise/) { get; } | Removes noise (pixels that have randomly distributed color levels) from a bitmap image. |
| [Gamma](../../aspose.diagram/image/gamma/) { get; } | Adjusts or corrects the intensity of an image for a particular output device, such as a monitor or scanner. The default value is 1 (no correction. |
| [Sharpen](../../aspose.diagram/image/sharpen/) { get; } | Specifies the amount to sharpen a bitmap image. Sharpening an image focuses it by increasing the contrast of adjacent pixels. |
| [Transparency](../../aspose.diagram/image/transparency/) { get; } | Specifies the transparency level for a layer color, from 0 (opaque) to 1 (completely transparent). |
