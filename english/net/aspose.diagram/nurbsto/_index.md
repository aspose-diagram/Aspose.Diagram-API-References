## NURBSTo class

Contains the x- and y-coordinates, position of the second to last knot, position of the last weight, position of the first knot, position of the first weight, and the formula for a nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS). This information is specified in the X, Y, A, B, C, D, and E elements, respectively.

```csharp
public class NURBSTo : Coordinate
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [A](a) { get; set; } | The second-to-last knot of the nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS). |
| [B](b) { get; set; } | The last weight of the nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS). |
| [C](c) { get; set; } | The first knot of the nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS). |
| [D](d) { get; set; } | The first weight of the nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) |
| override [Del](del) { get; set; } | A flag indicating whether the element has been deleted locally. A value of 1 indicates that the element was deleted locally. |
| [E](e) { get; set; } | Contains a nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) formula. |
| override [IX](ix) { get; set; } | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |
| [X](x) { get; set; } | The x-coordinate of the last control point of a nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS). |
| [Y](y) { get; set; } | The y-coordinate of the last control point of a nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS). |
