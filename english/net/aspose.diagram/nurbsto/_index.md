## NURBSTo class

Contains the x- and y-coordinates, position of the second to last knot, position of the last weight, position of the first knot, position of the first weight, and the formula for a nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS). This information is specified in the X, Y, A, B, C, D, and E elements, respectively.

```csharp
public class NURBSTo : Coordinate
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [NURBSTo](nurbsto)() | Creates an instance of the [`NURBSTo`](../nurbsto) class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [A](../../aspose.diagram/nurbsto/a) { get; set; } | The second-to-last knot of the nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS). |
| [B](../../aspose.diagram/nurbsto/b) { get; set; } | The last weight of the nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS). |
| [C](../../aspose.diagram/nurbsto/c) { get; set; } | The first knot of the nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS). |
| [D](../../aspose.diagram/nurbsto/d) { get; set; } | The first weight of the nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) |
| override [Del](../../aspose.diagram/nurbsto/del) { get; set; } | A flag indicating whether the element has been deleted locally. A value of 1 indicates that the element was deleted locally. |
| [E](../../aspose.diagram/nurbsto/e) { get; set; } | Contains a nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) formula. |
| override [IX](../../aspose.diagram/nurbsto/ix) { get; set; } | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |
| [X](../../aspose.diagram/nurbsto/x) { get; set; } | The x-coordinate of the last control point of a nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS). |
| [Y](../../aspose.diagram/nurbsto/y) { get; set; } | The y-coordinate of the last control point of a nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS). |
