```csharp
public class CoordinateCollection : Collection
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ArcToCol](../../aspose.diagram/coordinatecollection/arctocol) { get; } | Contains the x- and y-coordinates and bow of a circular arc represented respectively by the X, Y, and A elements. |
| [Count](../../aspose.diagram/collection/count) { get; } | Gets the number of elements actually contained in the collection. |
| [EllipseCol](../../aspose.diagram/coordinatecollection/ellipsecol) { get; } | Contains elements specifying the x- and y-coordinates of the ellipse's center point and two points on the ellipse. |
| [EllipticalArcToCol](../../aspose.diagram/coordinatecollection/ellipticalarctocol) { get; } | Contains elements that specify information about an elliptical arc. |
| [InfiniteLineCol](../../aspose.diagram/coordinatecollection/infinitelinecol) { get; } | Contains elements specifying the x- and y-coordinates of two points on an infinite line. The X and Y elements specify the x- and y-coordinates of the first point, and the A and B elements specify the x- and y-coordinates of the second point. |
| [Item](../../aspose.diagram/coordinatecollection/item) { get; } | Gets the element at the specified index. |
| [LineToCol](../../aspose.diagram/coordinatecollection/linetocol) { get; } | Contains x- and y-coordinates of the ending vertex of a straight line segment. These coordinates are contained in the X and Y elements, respectively. |
| [MoveToCol](../../aspose.diagram/coordinatecollection/movetocol) { get; } | Contains the x- and y-coordinates of the first vertex of a shape, or contains the x- and y-coordinates of the first vertex after a break in a path. |
| [NURBSToCol](../../aspose.diagram/coordinatecollection/nurbstocol) { get; } | Contains the x- and y-coordinates, position of the second to last knot, position of the last weight, position of the first knot, position of the first weight, and the formula for a nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS). This information is specified in the X, Y, A, B, C, D, and E elements, respectively. |
| [PolylineToCol](../../aspose.diagram/coordinatecollection/polylinetocol) { get; } | Contains x- and y-coordinates of the last point of a polyline and a polyline formula. The coordinates are specified in the X and Y elements, and the formula is specified in the A element. |
| [RelCubBezToCol](../../aspose.diagram/coordinatecollection/relcubbeztocol) { get; } | Contains x- and y-coordinates for a RelCubBezTo's points.Coordinates are specified as relative coordinates. |
| [RelEllipticalArcToCol](../../aspose.diagram/coordinatecollection/relellipticalarctocol) { get; } | Contains elements that specify information about an elliptical arc.Coordinates are specified as relative coordinates. |
| [RelLineToCol](../../aspose.diagram/coordinatecollection/rellinetocol) { get; } | Contains x- and y-coordinates of the ending vertex of a straight line segment. These coordinates are contained in the X and Y elements, respectively.Coordinates are specified as relative coordinates. |
| [RelMoveToCol](../../aspose.diagram/coordinatecollection/relmovetocol) { get; } | Contains the x- and y-coordinates of the first vertex of a shape, or contains the x- and y-coordinates of the first vertex after a break in a path.Coordinates are specified as relative coordinates. |
| [RelQuadBezToCol](../../aspose.diagram/coordinatecollection/relquadbeztocol) { get; } | Contains x- and y-coordinates for a RelQuadBezTo's points.Coordinates are specified as relative coordinates. |
| [SplineKnotCol](../../aspose.diagram/coordinatecollection/splineknotcol) { get; } | Contains x- and y-coordinates for a spline's control point and a spline's knot, represented by the X, Y, and A elements, respectively. |
| [SplineStartCol](../../aspose.diagram/coordinatecollection/splinestartcol) { get; } | Contains x- and y-coordinates for a spline's second control point, its second knot, its first knot, the last knot, and the degree of the spline. This information is contained in the X, Y, A, B, C, and D elements, respectively. |
