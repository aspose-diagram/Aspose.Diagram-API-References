```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Del](../../aspose.diagram/textxform/del/) { get; set; } | A flag indicating whether the element has been deleted locally. A value of 1 indicates that the element was deleted locally. |
| [TxtAngle](../../aspose.diagram/textxform/txtangle/) { get; set; } | Specifies the text block's current angle of rotation in relation to the x-axis of the shape. The default is 0 degrees. |
| [TxtHeight](../../aspose.diagram/textxform/txtheight/) { get; set; } | Specifies the height of the text block. The default formula, which evaluates to the height of the shape, is F="Height*1". |
| [TxtLocPinX](../../aspose.diagram/textxform/txtlocpinx/) { get; set; } | Specifies the x-coordinate of the text block's center of rotation in relation to the origin of the text block. The default formula, which evaluates to the horizontal center of the text block, is F="TxtWidth*0.5". |
| [TxtLocPinY](../../aspose.diagram/textxform/txtlocpiny/) { get; set; } | Specifies the y-coordinate of the text block's center of rotation relative to the origin of the text block. The default formula, which evaluates to the vertical center of the text block, is F="TxtHeight*0.5". |
| [TxtPinX](../../aspose.diagram/textxform/txtpinx/) { get; set; } | Specifies the x-coordinate of the text block's center of rotation in relation to the origin of the shape. The default formula, which evaluates to the horizontal center of the shape, is F="Width*0.5". |
| [TxtPinY](../../aspose.diagram/textxform/txtpiny/) { get; set; } | Specifies the y-coordinate of the text block's center of rotation in relation to the origin of the shape. The default formula, which evaluates to the vertical center of the shape, is F="Height*0.5". |
| [TxtWidth](../../aspose.diagram/textxform/txtwidth/) { get; set; } | Specifies the width of the text block. The default formula, which evaluates to the width of the shape, is F="Width*1". |
