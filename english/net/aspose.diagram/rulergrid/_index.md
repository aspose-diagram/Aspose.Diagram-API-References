| [Del](../../aspose.diagram/rulergrid/del/) { get; set; } | A flag indicating whether the element has been deleted locally. A value of 1 indicates that the element was deleted locally. |
| [XGridDensity](../../aspose.diagram/rulergrid/xgriddensity/) { get; } | Specifies the zero point on the y-axis (vertical) ruler for the page. |
| [XGridOrigin](../../aspose.diagram/rulergrid/xgridorigin/) { get; } | Specifies the horizontal coordinate of the grid origin for a page. |
| [XGridSpacing](../../aspose.diagram/rulergrid/xgridspacing/) { get; } | Specifies the distance between horizontal lines in a fixed grid (that is, a RulerGrid element where the XGridDensity element is set to 0). |
| [XRulerDensity](../../aspose.diagram/rulergrid/xrulerdensity/) { get; } | Specifies the horizontal subdivisions on the ruler for the page. |
| [XRulerOrigin](../../aspose.diagram/rulergrid/xrulerorigin/) { get; } | Specifies the zero point on the x-axis (horizontal) ruler for the page. |
| [YGridDensity](../../aspose.diagram/rulergrid/ygriddensity/) { get; } | Specifies the type of vertical grid to use for a page. |
| [YGridOrigin](../../aspose.diagram/rulergrid/ygridorigin/) { get; } | Specifies the vertical origin of the grid on the page. |
| [YGridSpacing](../../aspose.diagram/rulergrid/ygridspacing/) { get; } | Specifies the distance between vertical lines in a fixed grid (that is, a RulerGrid element where the YGridDensity element is set to 0). |
| [YRulerDensity](../../aspose.diagram/rulergrid/yrulerdensity/) { get; } | Specifies the vertical subdivisions on the ruler for the page. |
| [YRulerOrigin](../../aspose.diagram/rulergrid/yrulerorigin/) { get; } | Specifies the zero point on the y-axis (vertical) ruler for the page. |
