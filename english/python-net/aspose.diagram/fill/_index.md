## Fill class

Contains the current fill formatting values for the shape and the shape's drop shadow, including pattern, foreground color, and background color.



The Fill type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [fill_foregnd](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/fill/fill_foregnd) | Specifies the color used for the foreground (stroke) of the shape's fill pattern. |
| [gradient_fill](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/fill/gradient_fill) | Contains the current gradient fill formatting values for the shape |
| [fill_bkgnd](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/fill/fill_bkgnd) | Specifies the color used for the background of the shape's fill pattern. |
| [fill_pattern](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/fill/fill_pattern) | Specifies the fill pattern for the shape. |
| [shdw_foregnd](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/fill/shdw_foregnd) | Specifies the color used for the foreground (stroke) of the shape's drop shadow fill pattern. |
| [shdw_bkgnd](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/fill/shdw_bkgnd) | Specifies the color used for the background (fill) of the shape's drop shadow fill pattern. |
| [shdw_pattern](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/fill/shdw_pattern) | Specifies the fill pattern for a shape's shadow. |
| [fill_foregnd_trans](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/fill/fill_foregnd_trans) | Specifies the transparency level for the foreground (fill) color of the shape's fill pattern, from 0 (completely opaque) to 1 (completely transparent). |
| [fill_bkgnd_trans](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/fill/fill_bkgnd_trans) | Specifies the transparency level for the background (fill) color of the shape's fill pattern, from 0 (completely opaque) to 1 (completely transparent). |
| [shdw_foregnd_trans](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/fill/shdw_foregnd_trans) | Specifies transparency level for the foreground (stroke) of the shape's drop shadow fill pattern, from 0.0 (completely opaque) to 1.0 (completely transparent). |
| [shdw_bkgnd_trans](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/fill/shdw_bkgnd_trans) | Specifies transparency level for the background (fill) of the shape's drop shadow fill pattern, from 0.0 (completely opaque) to 1.0 (completely transparent). |
| [shape_shdw_type](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/fill/shape_shdw_type) | Specifies the type of shadow for a shape. |
| [shape_shdw_show](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/fill/shape_shdw_show) | Specifies the type of shadow for a shape. |
| [shape_shdw_offset_x](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/fill/shape_shdw_offset_x) | Determines the distance in page units that a shape's shadow is offset horizontally from the shape. |
| [shape_shdw_offset_y](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/fill/shape_shdw_offset_y) | Determines the distance in page units that a shape's shadow is offset vertically from the shape. |
| [shape_shdw_oblique_angle](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/fill/shape_shdw_oblique_angle) | Specifies the angle of oblique direction of a shape's shadow. |
| [shape_shdw_scale_factor](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/fill/shape_shdw_scale_factor) | Specifies the percentage by which the shadow of a shape can be enlarged or reduced. |
| [shape_shdw_blur](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/fill/shape_shdw_blur) | Specifies the shadow blur size of a shape.<br/>cannot draw blur now, but can parse from vsdx now. |
