## TextBlock class

Contains elements that specify the alignment, margins, and default tab stop positions of text in a shape's text block.



The TextBlock type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [left_margin](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/textblock/left_margin) | Specifies the distance between the left border of the text block and the text it contains. This value is independent of the scale of the drawing. If the drawing is scaled, the left margin remains the same. |
| [right_margin](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/textblock/right_margin) | Specifies the distance between the right border of the text block and the text it contains. This value is independent of the scale of the drawing. If the drawing is scaled, the right margin remains the same. |
| [top_margin](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/textblock/top_margin) | Specifies the distance between the top border of the text block and the first line of text it contains. |
| [bottom_margin](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/textblock/bottom_margin) | Determines the distance between the bottom border of the text block and the last line of text it contains. The default is 4 pt. This value is independent of the scale of the drawing. If the drawing is scaled, the bottom margin remains the same. |
| [vertical_align](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/textblock/vertical_align) | Specifies the vertical alignment of text within the text block. |
| [text_bkgnd](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/textblock/text_bkgnd) | Specifies the text background color for a shape. |
| [default_tab_stop](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/textblock/default_tab_stop) | Specifies the interval of the default tab stops in a text block. |
| [text_direction](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/textblock/text_direction) | Specifies the direction of the characters in a text block. |
| [text_bkgnd_trans](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/textblock/text_bkgnd_trans) | Specifies the transparency level for the background color of a shape's text block, from 0 (completely opaque) to 1 (completely transparent). |
