## value property


When it is contained in a Group element, the DisplayMode element specifies how a group shape and its members are displayed.
When it is contained in a SmartTagDef element, the DisplayMode element determines whether the smart tag appears when the user pauses the mouse over the tag, when the shape is selected, or all the time.
