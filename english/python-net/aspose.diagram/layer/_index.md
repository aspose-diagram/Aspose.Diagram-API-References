## Layer class

Contains elements that define a single layer and its properties for a page.



The Layer type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [Layer()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layer/__init__/#) | Constructor. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [ix](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layer/ix) | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |
| [name](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layer/name) | Name element specifies the name of a layer. |
| [color](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layer/color) | The index of the color in the color table used toThe index of the color in the color table used to display the layer or An RGB value specifying a custom color not in the color table (for example, #ff9900 ). display the layer |
| [is_color_checked](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layer/is_color_checked) | A flag indicating whether the element has been checked locally. A value of 1 indicates that the element was checked locally. |
| [status](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layer/status) | Specifies whether the layer is a valid layer for a document. |
| [visible](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layer/visible) | Specifies whether shapes belonging to the layer are visible on the drawing page. |
| [print](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layer/print) | Specifies whether shapes belonging to the layer are printed when the drawing is printed. |
| [active](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layer/active) | Specifies whether a layer is active. Shapes that are not preassigned to layers are assigned to the active layer(s) when dropped on the drawing page. |
| [lock](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layer/lock) | Specifies whether shapes belonging to the layer are locked against being selected or edited. |
| [snap](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layer/snap) | Specifies whether other shapes can snap to shapes assigned to the layer. Shapes assigned to the layer can snap to other shapes, but other shapes cannot snap to them. |
| [glue](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layer/glue) | Specifies whether shapes belonging to the layer can be glued to. |
| [name_univ](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layer/name_univ) | Specifies the universal name of a layer. |
| [color_trans](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layer/color_trans) | Determines the degree of transparency for a layer or shape's text color, from 0 (completely opaque) to 1 (completely transparent). |
