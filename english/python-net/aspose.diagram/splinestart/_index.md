## SplineStart class

Contains x- and y-coordinates for a spline's second control point, its second knot, its first knot, the last knot, and the degree of the spline. This information is contained in the X, Y, A, B, C, and D elements, respectively.



**Inheritance:** [SplineStart](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/splinestart) → 
[Coordinate](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/coordinate)



The SplineStart type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [SplineStart()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/splinestart/__init__/#) | Creates an instance of [SplineStart](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/splinestart) class. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [ix](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/splinestart/ix) | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |
| [x](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/splinestart/x) | The x-coordinate of a spline's second control point. |
| [y](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/splinestart/y) | The y-coordinate of a spline's second control point. |
| [a](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/splinestart/a) | The second knot of the spline. |
| [b](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/splinestart/b) | The first knot of a spline. |
| [c](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/splinestart/c) | The last knot of the spline. |
| [d](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/splinestart/d) | The degree of the spline (an integer from 1 to 25). |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [clone()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/splinestart/clone/#) | Creates deep copy of this instance. |
