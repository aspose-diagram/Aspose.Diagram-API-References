## Layout class

Contains elements that control shape placement and connector routing settings.



The Layout type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [shape_place_style](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layout/shape_place_style) | Determines the placement style for children. |
| [shape_permeable_x](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layout/shape_permeable_x) | Specifies whether a connector can route horizontally through a shape. |
| [shape_permeable_y](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layout/shape_permeable_y) | Specifies whether a connector can route vertically through a shape. |
| [shape_permeable_place](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layout/shape_permeable_place) | Specifies whether placeable shapes can be placed on top of a shape when a user selects Lay Out Shapes (Shapes menu). |
| [shape_fixed_code](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layout/shape_fixed_code) | Specifies placement behavior for a placeable shape. |
| [shape_plow_code](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layout/shape_plow_code) | Specifies whether a placeable shape moves away when you drag another placeable shape near the shape on the drawing page. |
| [shape_route_style](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layout/shape_route_style) | Specifies the routing style and direction for a connector on the drawing page. |
| [con_fixed_code](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layout/con_fixed_code) | Determines when a connector reroutes. |
| [con_line_jump_code](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layout/con_line_jump_code) | Determines whether a connector jumps when two connectors cross, |
| [con_line_jump_style](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layout/con_line_jump_style) | Determines the line jump style for line jumps on a dynamic connector. |
| [con_line_jump_dir_x](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layout/con_line_jump_dir_x) | Determines the line jump direction for line jumps occurring on a horizontal segment of a dynamic connector. |
| [con_line_jump_dir_y](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layout/con_line_jump_dir_y) | Determines the line jump direction for line jumps occurring on a vertical segment of a dynamic connector. |
| [shape_place_flip](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layout/shape_place_flip) | Specifies how a placeable shape flips and/or rotates on the page when a user selects Lay Out Shapes (Shapes menu). |
| [con_line_route_ext](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layout/con_line_route_ext) | Determines the appearance of a connector. |
| [shape_split](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layout/shape_split) | Determines whether this shape can split shapes that are splittable. |
| [shape_splittable](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layout/shape_splittable) | Determines whether this 1-D shape can be split. |
| [relationships](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layout/relationships) | Stores the relationships between containers, lists, callouts, and shapes. |
| [display_level](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/layout/display_level) | Determines the display level band (the relative range of Z-order grouping) for the shape. |
