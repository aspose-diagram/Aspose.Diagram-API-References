Specifies the type of projection of the effect properties of a shape



The RotationTypeValue type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| NONE | Specifies no 3D effects rotation. |
| PARALLEL | Specifies that a parallel projection is applied to the 3D effect properties. |
| PERSPECTIVE | Specifies that the shape rotates in perspective projection. |
| OBLIQUE_FROM_TOP_LEFT | Specifies that the shape rotates in oblique projection from the top left corner of the bounding box of the shape. |
| OBLIQUE_FROM_TOP_RIGHT | Specifies that the shape rotates oblique projection from the top right corner of the bounding box of the shape. |
| OBLIQUE_FROM_BOTTOM_LEFT | Specifies that the shape rotates oblique projection from the bottom left corner of the bounding box of the shape. |
| OBLIQUE_FROM_BOTTOM_RIGHT | Specifies that the shape rotates oblique projection from the bottom right corner of the bounding box of the shape. |
| UNDEFINED | No light rig. |
