## SplineKnot class

Contains x- and y-coordinates for a spline's control point and a spline's knot, represented by the X, Y, and A elements, respectively.



**Inheritance:** [SplineKnot](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/splineknot) → 
[Coordinate](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/coordinate)



The SplineKnot type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [SplineKnot()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/splineknot/__init__/#) | Creates an instance of the [SplineKnot](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/splineknot) class. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [ix](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/splineknot/ix) | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |
| [x](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/splineknot/x) | The x-coordinate of a control point. |
| [y](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/splineknot/y) | The y-coordinate of a control point. |
| [a](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/splineknot/a) | One of the spline's knots (other than the last one or the first two). |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [clone()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/splineknot/clone/#) | Creates deep copy of this instance. |
