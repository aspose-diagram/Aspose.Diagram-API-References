## NURBSTo class

Contains the x- and y-coordinates, position of the second to last knot, position of the last weight, position of the first knot, position of the first weight, and the formula for a nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS). This information is specified in the X, Y, A, B, C, D, and E elements, respectively.



**Inheritance:** [NURBSTo](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/nurbsto) → 
[Coordinate](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/coordinate)



The NURBSTo type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [NURBSTo()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/nurbsto/__init__/#) | Creates an instance of the [NURBSTo](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/nurbsto) class. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [ix](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/nurbsto/ix) | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |
| [x](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/nurbsto/x) | The x-coordinate of the last control point of a nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS). |
| [y](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/nurbsto/y) | The y-coordinate of the last control point of a nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS). |
| [a](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/nurbsto/a) | The second-to-last knot of the nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS). |
| [b](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/nurbsto/b) | The last weight of the nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS). |
| [c](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/nurbsto/c) | The first knot of the nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS). |
| [d](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/nurbsto/d) | The first weight of the nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) |
| [e](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/nurbsto/e) | Contains a nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) formula. |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
