## StyleSheet class

Represents a style defined in a document.



The StyleSheet type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [StyleSheet()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/__init__/#) | Constructor. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [id](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/id) | The unique ID of the element within its parent element. |
| [name](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/name) | The name of the element. |
| [name_u](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/name_u) | The universal name of the element. |
| [line_style](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/line_style) | StyleSheet element from which this style inherits line formatting. |
| [fill_style](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/fill_style) | StyleSheet element from which this style inherits fill formatting. |
| [text_style](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/text_style) | StyleSheet element from which this style inherits text formatting. |
| [line](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/line) | Contains elements that control line attributes for a shape, such as pattern, weight, and color. These elements determine whether the line ends are formatted (for example, with an arrowhead), the size of line end formats, radius of the rounding circle applied to the line, and line cap style (round or square). |
| [fill](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/fill) | Contains the current fill formatting values for the shape and the shape's drop shadow, including pattern, foreground color, and background color. |
| [event](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/event) | Contains elements that specify formulas that control shape events. |
| [style_prop](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/style_prop) | Contains elements that control style behavior, such as whether a style includes text, line, and fill attributes. |
| [text_block](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/text_block) | Contains elements that specify the alignment, margins, and default tab stop positions of text in a shape's text block. |
| [protection](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/protection) | Locking helps prevent inadvertent changes to the shape but does not prevent Microsoft Visio from resetting values in other circumstances. It also does not protect against changes made in the ShapeSheet window. |
| [help](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/help) | Contains elements specifying the Shape element's Help file topic and copyright information. |
| [misc](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/misc) | Contains elements specifying the Shape element's Help file topic and copyright information. |
| [ruler_grid](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/ruler_grid) | Contains elements that specify the settings of the page's rulers and grid. |
| [image](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/image) | Contains the gamma, brightness, contrast, blur, sharpen, denoise, and transparency values for a bitmap. |
| [group](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/group) | Contains elements that control how you add shapes to a group, move members of a group, and select groups. |
| [layout](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/layout) | Contains elements that control shape placement and connector routing settings. |
| [page_layout](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/page_layout) | Contains Diagram that control the page layout settings for shapes and connectors, such as spacing between all shapes on the page, spacing between all connectors on the page, and routing style for all connectors on the page. |
| [chars](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/chars) | Contains a collection of Char elements. |
| [paras](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/paras) | Contains a collection of Para elements. |
| [tabs_collection](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/tabs_collection) | Contains a collection of Tab elements. |
| [connections](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/connections) | Contains a collection of Connection elements. |
| [connection_abc_ds](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/connection_abc_ds) | Contains a collection of ConnectionABCD elements. |
| [foreign](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/foreign) | Contains elements specifying the width and height of an object from another program used in a Microsoft Visio document. Also includes elements specifying the distance the object's image is offset within its borders. |
| [foreign_data](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/stylesheet/foreign_data) | Contains a MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) encoded BLOB of picture data, such as Windows metafile, bitmap, or OLE data. |
