## Align class

Indicates the alignment of a shape with respect to the guide or guide point to which the shape is glued. The Align element appears only for shapes that are glued to guides or guide points.



The Align type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [align_left](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/align/align_left) | Determines the horizontal position, relative to the origin of its parent, of a vertical guide or guide point to which the shape's left border is aligned. |
| [align_center](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/align/align_center) | Determines the horizontal position, relative to the origin of its parent, of a vertical guide or guide point to which the shape's horizontal center is aligned. |
| [align_right](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/align/align_right) | Determines the horizontal position, relative to the origin of its parent, of a vertical guide or guide point to which the shape's right border is aligned. |
| [align_top](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/align/align_top) | Determines the vertical position, relative to the origin of its parent, of a horizontal guide or guide point to which the shape's top border is aligned. |
| [align_middle](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/align/align_middle) | Determines the vertical position, relative to the origin of its parent, of a horizontal guide or guide point to which the shape's vertical center is aligned. |
| [align_bottom](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/align/align_bottom) | Determines the vertical position, relative to the origin of its parent, of a horizontal guide or guide point to which the shape's bottom border is aligned. |
