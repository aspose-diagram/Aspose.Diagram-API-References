[Coordinate](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/coordinate)



The RelCubBezTo type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [RelCubBezTo()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/relcubbezto/__init__/#) | Creates an instance of [RelCubBezTo](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/relcubbezto) class. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [ix](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/relcubbezto/ix) | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |
| [x](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/relcubbezto/x) | The x-coordinate of the endpoint in relative coordinates. |
| [y](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/relcubbezto/y) | The y-coordinate of the endpoint in relative coordinates. |
| [a](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/relcubbezto/a) | The x-coordinate of the control point at the beginning of the curve in relative coordinates. |
| [b](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/relcubbezto/b) | The y-coordinate of the control point at the beginning of the curve in relative coordinates. |
