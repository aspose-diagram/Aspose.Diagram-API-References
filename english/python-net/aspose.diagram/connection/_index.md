## Connection class

Contains elements for one connection point defined for the shape.



The Connection type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [Connection()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connection/__init__/#) | Constructor. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [name](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connection/name) | The name of the element. |
| [name_u](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connection/name_u) | The universal name of the element. |
| [id](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connection/id) | The unique ID of the element within its parent element. |
| [ix](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connection/ix) | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |
| [x](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connection/x) | Specifies an x-coordinate on a shape in local coordinates. |
| [y](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connection/y) | Specifies a y-coordinate on a shape in local coordinates. Local coordinates are those whose frame of reference is the shape, instead of the page. |
| [dir_x](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connection/dir_x) | Specifies the x-component for the required alignment vector of a matching connection point. The DirX element is also used to orient the attached leg of a dynamic connector. |
| [dir_y](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connection/dir_y) | Specifies the y-component for the required alignment vector of a matching connection point. The DirY element is also used to orient the attached leg of a dynamic connector. |
| [type](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connection/type) | Specifies various types, based on the element in which it is contained. |
| [auto_gen](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connection/auto_gen) | Specifies if the connection point is generated automatically. A value of 1 indicates that the connection point is generated automatically. |
| [prompt](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connection/prompt) | Contains varying prompt information, based on the element in which it is contained. |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [clone()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connection/clone/#) | Creates deep copy of this instance. |
