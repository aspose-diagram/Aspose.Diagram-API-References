## Ellipse class

Contains elements specifying the x- and y-coordinates of the ellipse's center point and two points on the ellipse.



**Inheritance:** [Ellipse](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/ellipse) → 
[Coordinate](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/coordinate)



The Ellipse type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [Ellipse()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/ellipse/__init__/#) | Creates an instance of the [Ellipse](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/ellipse) class. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [ix](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/ellipse/ix) | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |
| [x](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/ellipse/x) | The x-coordinate of the center of the ellipse. |
| [y](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/ellipse/y) | The y-coordinate of the center of the ellipse. |
| [a](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/ellipse/a) | An x-coordinate of a point on the ellipse  paired with the y-coordinate represented by the B element. |
| [b](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/ellipse/b) | A y-coordinate of a point on an ellipse  paired with an x-coordinate represented by the A element. |
| [c](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/ellipse/c) | An x-coordinate of a point on the ellipse  paired with y-coordinate represented by the D element. |
| [d](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/ellipse/d) | A y-coordinate of a point on the ellipse  paired with x-coordinate represented by the C element. |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [clone()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/ellipse/clone/#) | Creates deep copy of this instance. |
