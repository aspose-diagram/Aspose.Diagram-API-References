## Image class

Contains the gamma, brightness, contrast, blur, sharpen, denoise, and transparency values for a bitmap.



The Image type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [gamma](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/image/gamma) | Adjusts or corrects the intensity of an image for a particular output device, such as a monitor or scanner. The default value is 1 (no correction. |
| [contrast](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/image/contrast) | Specifies the contrast of a bitmap image. The Contrast element contains a value between 0 and 1. |
| [brightness](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/image/brightness) | Adjusts the brightness of a bitmap image. The Brightness element contains a value between 0 and 1; the default value is 0.5. |
| [sharpen](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/image/sharpen) | Specifies the amount to sharpen a bitmap image. Sharpening an image focuses it by increasing the contrast of adjacent pixels. |
| [blur](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/image/blur) | Blurs or softens a bitmap image. The Blur element contains a value between 0 and 1; the default value is 0. |
| [denoise](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/image/denoise) | Removes noise (pixels that have randomly distributed color levels) from a bitmap image. |
| [transparency](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/image/transparency) | Specifies the transparency level for a layer color, from 0 (opaque) to 1 (completely transparent). |
