## RelMoveTo class

Contains the x- and y-coordinates of the first vertex of a shape, or contains the x- and y-coordinates of the first vertex after a break in a path.Coordinates are specified as relative coordinates.



**Inheritance:** [RelMoveTo](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/relmoveto) → 
[Coordinate](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/coordinate)



The RelMoveTo type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [RelMoveTo()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/relmoveto/__init__/#) | Creates an instance of the [MoveTo](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/moveto) class. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [ix](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/relmoveto/ix) | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |
| [x](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/relmoveto/x) | X element represents the x-coordinate of the first vertex of a path. If the MoveTo element appears between two elements, the X element represents the x-coordinate of the first vertex after the break in the path |
| [y](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/relmoveto/y) | Y element represents the y-coordinate of the first vertex of a path. If the MoveTo element appears between two elements, the Y element represents the y-coordinate of the first vertex after the break in the path. |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [clone()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/relmoveto/clone/#) | Creates deep copy of this instance. |
