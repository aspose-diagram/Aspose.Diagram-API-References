## RulerGrid class

Contains elements that specify the settings of the page's rulers and grid.



The RulerGrid type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [x_ruler_density](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/rulergrid/x_ruler_density) | Specifies the horizontal subdivisions on the ruler for the page. |
| [y_ruler_density](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/rulergrid/y_ruler_density) | Specifies the vertical subdivisions on the ruler for the page. |
| [x_ruler_origin](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/rulergrid/x_ruler_origin) | Specifies the zero point on the x-axis (horizontal) ruler for the page. |
| [x_grid_density](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/rulergrid/x_grid_density) | Specifies the zero point on the y-axis (vertical) ruler for the page. |
| [y_grid_density](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/rulergrid/y_grid_density) | Specifies the type of vertical grid to use for a page. |
| [x_grid_spacing](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/rulergrid/x_grid_spacing) | Specifies the distance between horizontal lines in a fixed grid (that is, a RulerGrid element where the XGridDensity element is set to 0). |
| [y_grid_spacing](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/rulergrid/y_grid_spacing) | Specifies the distance between vertical lines in a fixed grid (that is, a RulerGrid element where the YGridDensity element is set to 0). |
| [x_grid_origin](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/rulergrid/x_grid_origin) | Specifies the horizontal coordinate of the grid origin for a page. |
| [y_grid_origin](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/rulergrid/y_grid_origin) | Specifies the vertical origin of the grid on the page. |
| [y_ruler_origin](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/rulergrid/y_ruler_origin) | Specifies the zero point on the y-axis (vertical) ruler for the page. |
