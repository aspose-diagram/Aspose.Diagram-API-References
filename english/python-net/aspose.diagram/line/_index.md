## Line class

Contains elements specifying general positioning information about a shape.



The Line type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [line_weight](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/line/line_weight) | Specifies the line weight of a shape. Line weight is independent of the scale of the drawing. If the drawing is scaled, the line weight remains the same. |
| [gradient_line](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/line/gradient_line) | Contains the current gradient line formatting values for the shape |
| [line_color](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/line/line_color) | Specifies the line color of the shape. |
| [compound_type](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/line/compound_type) | Specifies the line CompoundType of the shape. |
| [line_pattern](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/line/line_pattern) | Specifies the line pattern of the shape |
| [rounding](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/line/rounding) | Specifies the radius of the rounding arc applied where two contiguous segments of a path meet. For example, rounding can be used to give a rectangle rounded corners. |
| [end_arrow_size](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/line/end_arrow_size) | Specifies the size of the arrowhead at the end of the line. |
| [begin_arrow](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/line/begin_arrow) | Indicates whether a line has an arrowhead or other line end format at its first vertex. Enter a number from 0 to 45 or the USE function with the name of a custom line end. |
| [end_arrow](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/line/end_arrow) | Indicates whether a line has an arrowhead or other line-end format at its last vertex. |
| [line_cap](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/line/line_cap) | Specifies whether a line has rounded or square line ends. |
| [begin_arrow_size](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/line/begin_arrow_size) | Determines the size of the arrowhead at the beginning of the line. Enter a number from 0 to 6. |
| [line_color_trans](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/line/line_color_trans) | Specifies the transparency level of a shape's line color, from 0 (opaque) to 1 (completely transparent). The default is 0. |
