## ForeignData class

Contains a MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) encoded BLOB of picture data, such as Windows metafile, bitmap, or OLE data.



The ForeignData type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [image_data](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/foreigndata/image_data) | Represents image of ole object as byte array. |
| [object_data](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/foreigndata/object_data) | Represents embedded ole object data as byte array. |
| [foreign_type](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/foreigndata/foreign_type) | Data type. |
| [object_type](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/foreigndata/object_type) | If the ForeignType attribute is "Object", the ForeignData element must also have an ObjectType attribute. |
| [show_as_icon](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/foreigndata/show_as_icon) | This attribute is only meaningful if the foreign data is an OLE2 embedded object. |
| [object_width](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/foreigndata/object_width) | This attribute is only meaningful if the foreign data is an OLE2 embedded object. The value expresses the width of the object in page units. |
| [object_height](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/foreigndata/object_height) | This attribute is only meaningful if the foreign data is an OLE2 embedded object. The value expresses the height of the object in page units. |
| [mapping_mode](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/foreigndata/mapping_mode) | This attribute is only meaningful if the foreign data is a metafile. The value indicates the metafile mapping mode. |
| [extent_x](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/foreigndata/extent_x) | This attribute is only meaningful if the foreign data is a metafile. The value indicates the horizontal extent of the metafile. |
| [extent_y](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/foreigndata/extent_y) | This attribute is only meaningful if the foreign data is a metafile. The value indicates the vertical extent of the metafile. |
| [compression_type](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/foreigndata/compression_type) | This attribute is only meaningful if the foreign data is a raster-based foreign object, such as a DIB, JPG, PNG, TIFF, or GIF file. The value indicates the type of compression applied to the file. |
| [compression_level](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/foreigndata/compression_level) | This attribute is only meaningful if the foreign data is a raster-based foreign object, such as a DIB, JPG, PNG, TIFF, or GIF file. The value indicates the level of compression applied to the file. Compression level is measured in hundreds of a percent. |
| [value](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/foreigndata/value) | Contains a MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) encoded BLOB of picture data, such as Windows metafile, bitmap, or OLE data. |
| [object_source_full_name](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/foreigndata/object_source_full_name) | Returns the source full name of the source file for the linked OLE object. |
