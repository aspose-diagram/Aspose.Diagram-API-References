### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [ConnectionABCD()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connectionabcd/__init__/#) | Constructor. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [name](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connectionabcd/name) | The name of the element. |
| [name_u](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connectionabcd/name_u) | The universal name of the element. |
| [id](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connectionabcd/id) | The unique ID of the element within its parent element. |
| [ix](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connectionabcd/ix) | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |
| [x](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connectionabcd/x) | Specifies an x-coordinate on a shape in local coordinates. The following table describes the X element based on the element that contains it. |
| [y](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connectionabcd/y) | Specifies a y-coordinate on a shape in local coordinates. Local coordinates are those whose frame of reference is the shape, instead of the page. |
| [a](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connectionabcd/a) | Represents different information depending on its parent element. |
| [b](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connectionabcd/b) | Represents different information depending on its parent element. |
| [c](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connectionabcd/c) | Represents different information based on its parent element. |
| [d](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/connectionabcd/d) | Represents different information based on its parent element. |


### Methods
