## Char class

Contains the formatting attributes for the shape's text, such as font, color, text style, case, position relative to the baseline, and point size.



The Char type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |

| [Char()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/char/__init__/#) | Constructor. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [ix](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/char/ix) | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |

| [font_scale](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/char/font_scale) | Specifies the font width. |
| [locale](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/char/locale) | It specified the locale of the text run for spell-checking purposes. |
| [size](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/char/size) | Specifies the size of the text in the shape's text block. |
| [dbl_underline](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/char/dbl_underline) | Specifies whether the range of text has a double underline below it. |
| [overline](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/char/overline) | Specifies whether the text has a line above it. |
| [highlight](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/char/highlight) | It specified highlight. |
| [perpendicular](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/char/perpendicular) | It specified whether a text field appears perpendicular to the other text in a text block. |
| [strikethru](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/char/strikethru) | Specifies whether the text is formatted as strikethrough. |
| [double_strikethrough](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/char/double_strikethrough) | Determines whether text is formatted as double strikethrough. |
| [rtl_text](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/char/rtl_text) | Determines if the text direction of the current character run is left to right or right to left. |
| [use_vertical](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/char/use_vertical) | Determines whether the character run is vertical or horizontal. |
| [letterspace](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/char/letterspace) | Specifies the amount of space between two or more characters. Space can be added or subtracted in 1/20th point increments. |
| [color_trans](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/char/color_trans) | Determines the degree of transparency for a layer or shape's text color, from 0 (completely opaque) to 1 (completely transparent). |
| [asian_font](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/char/asian_font) | Specifies the ID number of the font used to format text containing Asian characters. |
| [asian_font_name](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/char/asian_font_name) | It specified the asian font name of the font used to format the text.It is using for visio 2013 |
| [localize_font](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/char/localize_font) | Specifies whether the shape text should be localized (translated into another language). |
| [is_double_underline](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/char/is_double_underline) | Indicating whether the font is double underline. |
