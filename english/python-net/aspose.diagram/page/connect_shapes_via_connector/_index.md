## connect_shapes_via_connector(shape_from, place_from, shape_to, place_to, connector) {#Shape-aspose.diagram.manipulation.ConnectionPointPlace-Shape-aspose.diagram.manipulation.ConnectionPointPlace-Shape}

Connect shapes via connector.



```python
def connect_shapes_via_connector(self, shape_from, place_from, shape_to, place_to, connector):
    ...
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| shape_from | [Shape](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/shape) | The shape where the connector begins [Shape](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/shape). |
| place_from | aspose.diagram.manipulation.ConnectionPointPlace | The location on the first shape where connector will be connected [ConnectionPointPlace](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram.manipulation/connectionpointplace). |
| shape_to | [Shape](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/shape) | The shape where the connector ends [Shape](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/shape). |
| place_to | aspose.diagram.manipulation.ConnectionPointPlace | The location on the second shape where connector will be connected [ConnectionPointPlace](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram.manipulation/connectionpointplace). |
| connector | [Shape](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/shape) | The shape with type Dynamic connector [Shape](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/shape). |
