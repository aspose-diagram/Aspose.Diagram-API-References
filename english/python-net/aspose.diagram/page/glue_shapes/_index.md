## glue_shapes(shape_from, place_to, shape_to) {#Shape-aspose.diagram.manipulation.ConnectionPointPlace-Shape}

Glue shapes.



```python
def glue_shapes(self, shape_from, place_to, shape_to):
    ...
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| shape_from | [Shape](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/shape) | The shape which is glue from [Shape](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/shape). |
| place_to | aspose.diagram.manipulation.ConnectionPointPlace | The location on the first shape where to glue  [ConnectionPointPlace](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram.manipulation/connectionpointplace). |
| shape_to | [Shape](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/shape) | The shape where to glue to [Shape](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/shape). |
