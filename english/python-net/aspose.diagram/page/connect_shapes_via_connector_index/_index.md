## connect_shapes_via_connector_index(shape_from_id, from_index, shape_to_id, to_index, connector_id) {#int-int-int-int-int}

Connect shapes via connector index.



```python
def connect_shapes_via_connector_index(self, shape_from_id, from_index, shape_to_id, to_index, connector_id):
    ...
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| shape_from_id | int | The ID of shape where the connector begins [Shape](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/shape). |
| from_index | int | The index of the connection on the first shape |
| shape_to_id | int | The ID of shape where the connector ends [Shape](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/shape). |
| to_index | int | he index of the connection on the second shape |
| connector_id | int | The ID of shape with type Dynamic connector [Shape](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/shape). |
