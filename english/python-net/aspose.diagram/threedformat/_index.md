## ThreeDFormat class

Represents a shape's three-dimensional formatting.



The ThreeDFormat type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [bevel_bottom_height](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/threedformat/bevel_bottom_height) | Specifies the height of the bottom bevel on a 3D shape. |
| [bevel_bottom_type](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/threedformat/bevel_bottom_type) | Specifies the preset bevel type for the bottom bevel on a 3D shape |
| [bevel_bottom_width](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/threedformat/bevel_bottom_width) | Specifies the width of the bottom bevel on a 3D shape. |
| [bevel_contour_color](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/threedformat/bevel_contour_color) | Specifies the color of the outline on a 3D shape |
| [bevel_contour_size](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/threedformat/bevel_contour_size) | Specifies the thickness of the outline on a 3D shape |
| [bevel_depth_color](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/threedformat/bevel_depth_color) | Specifies the extrusion color on a 3D shape |

| [bevel_lighting_type](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/threedformat/bevel_lighting_type) | Specifies the preset type of lighting on a 3D shape |
| [bevel_material_type](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/threedformat/bevel_material_type) | Specifies the preset surface appearance on a 3D shape |
| [bevel_top_height](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/threedformat/bevel_top_height) | Specifies the height of the top bevel on a 3D shape |
| [bevel_top_width](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/threedformat/bevel_top_width) | Specifies the width of the top bevel on a 3D shape. |
| [bevel_top_type](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/threedformat/bevel_top_type) | Specifies the preset bevel type for the top bevel on a 3D shape |
| [distance_from_ground](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/threedformat/distance_from_ground) | Specifies the distance that a shape with 3D rotation properties |
| [perspective](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/threedformat/perspective) | Specifies the angle of view for a shape with 3D rotation properties |
| [rotation_type](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/threedformat/rotation_type) | Specifies the type of projection of the effect properties of a shape. |
| [rotation_x_angle](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/threedformat/rotation_x_angle) | Specifies the counterclockwise rotation angle of a shape around the y-axis. |
| [rotation_y_angle](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/threedformat/rotation_y_angle) | Specifies the counterclockwise rotation angle of a shape around the x-axis |
| [rotation_z_angle](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/threedformat/rotation_z_angle) | Specifies the counterclockwise rotation angle of a shape around the z-axis. |
