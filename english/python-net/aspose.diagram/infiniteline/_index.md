## InfiniteLine class

Contains elements specifying the x- and y-coordinates of two points on an infinite line. The X and Y elements specify the x- and y-coordinates of the first point, and the A and B elements specify the x- and y-coordinates of the second point.



**Inheritance:** [InfiniteLine](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/infiniteline) → 
[Coordinate](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/coordinate)



The InfiniteLine type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [InfiniteLine()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/infiniteline/__init__/#) | Creates an instance of the [InfiniteLine](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/infiniteline) class. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [ix](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/infiniteline/ix) | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |
| [x](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/infiniteline/x) | An x-coordinate of a point on the infinite line. |
| [y](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/infiniteline/y) | A y-coordinate of a point on the infinite line. |
| [a](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/infiniteline/a) | An x-coordinate of a point on the infinite line  paired with the y-coordinate represented by the B element. |
| [b](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/infiniteline/b) | A y-coordinate of a point on an infinite line   paired with an x-coordinate represented by the A element. |
