## CaseValue enumeration

Determines the case of a shape's text.
All capital (uppercase) letters (1) and initial capital letters (2) do not change the appearance of text that was entered in all capital letters. The text must be entered in lowercase letters for these options to show an effect.



The CaseValue type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| NORMAL_CASE | Normal case. |
| ALL_CAPITAL_LETTERS | All capital (uppercase) letters. |
| INITIAL_CAPITAL_LETTERS_ONLY | Initial capital letters only. |
| UNDEFINED | Undefined. |
