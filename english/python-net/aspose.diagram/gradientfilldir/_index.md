## GradientFillDir enumeration

Specifies the type of the fill color gradient of a shape



The GradientFillDir type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| LINEAR | Specifies a linear fill color gradient. |
| RADIAL_FROM_BOTTOM_RIGHT | Specifies the fill color gradient of the shape is in radial mode from the bottom right corner of the shape |
| RADIAL_FROM_BOTTOM_LEFT | Specifies the fill color gradient of the shape is in radial mode from the bottom left corner of the shape |
| RADIAL_FROM_CENTER | Specifies the fill color gradient of the shape is in radial mode from the center of the shape. |
| RADIAL_FROM_CENTER_BOTTOM | Specifies the fill color gradient of the shape is in radial mode from the center of the bottom edge of the shape. |
| RADIAL_FROM_CENTER_TOP | Specifies the fill color gradient of the shape is in radial mode from the center of the top edge of the shape |
| RADIAL_FROM_TOP_RIGHT | Specifies the fill color gradient of the shape is in radial mode from the top right corner of the shape |
| RADIAL_FROM_TOP_LEFT | Specifies the fill color gradient of the shape is in radial mode from the top left corner of the shape |
| RECTANGLE_FROM_BOTTOM_RIGHT | Specifies the fill color gradient of the shape is in rectangle mode from the bottom right corner of the shape |
| RECTANGLE_FROM_BOTTOM_LEFT | Specifies the fill color gradient of the shape is in rectangle mode from the bottom left corner of the shape |
| RECTANGLE_FROM_CENTER | Specifies the fill color gradient of the shape is in rectangle mode from the center of the shape. |
| RECTANGLE_FROM_TOP_RIGHT | Specifies the fill color gradient of the shape is in rectangle mode from the top right corner of the shape |
| RECTANGLE_FROM_TOP_LEFT | Specifies the fill color gradient of the shape is in rectangle mode from the top left corner of the shape |
| PATH | Specifies the fill color gradient of the shape is in path mode |
