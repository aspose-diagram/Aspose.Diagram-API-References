## CompressionType enumeration

This attribute is only meaningful if the foreign data is a raster-based foreign object, such as a DIB, JPG, PNG, TIFF, or GIF file. The value indicates the type of compression applied to the file.



The CompressionType type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| NO | No compression (the default). |
| JPEG | JPEG compression. |
| GIF | GIF compression. |
| TIFF | TIFF compression. |
| PNG | PNG compression. |
| UNDEFINED | Undefined. |
