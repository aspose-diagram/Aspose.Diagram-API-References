## UnitFormulaErrV class

Specified attributes of an element.



**Inheritance:** [UnitFormulaErrV](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/unitformulaerrv) → 
[UnitFormulaErr](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/unitformulaerr)



The UnitFormulaErrV type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [UnitFormulaErrV(unit, f, err, v)](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/unitformulaerrv/__init__/#MeasureConst-str-str-str) | Constructor. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [unit](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/unitformulaerrv/unit) | Units of measure. |
| [f](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/unitformulaerrv/f) | Represents the element's formula. |
| [err](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/unitformulaerrv/err) | Indicates that the formula evaluates to an error. |
| [v](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/unitformulaerrv/v) | Represents the null string condition for a string cell value. In some cases it is helpful to distinguish between an empty string cell null and a null string cell value. This attribute is used to distinguish between these forms of an empty value. |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [clone()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/unitformulaerrv/clone/#) | Creates deep copy of this instance. |
