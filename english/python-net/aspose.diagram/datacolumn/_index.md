## DataColumn class

Defines how a data column appears in the External Data window in the Visio user interface and qualifies the data in the column by defining its data type and formatting.



The DataColumn type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [DataColumn()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/datacolumn/__init__/#) | Constructor. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [column_name_id](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/datacolumn/column_name_id) | External name of the data column. Appears in the headings in the External Data window and in labels in data graphics. |
| [name](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/datacolumn/name) | Internal name of the data column. Used as the row name for the shape-data item (custom property) added to a shape when the shape is linked to a data row. |
| [label](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/datacolumn/label) | Label of the data column. |
| [orig_label](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/datacolumn/orig_label) | Column label returned to Visio by the underlying ADO interface. |
| [lang_id](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/datacolumn/lang_id) | The language ID of the data column |
| [calendar](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/datacolumn/calendar) | Calendar ID of the data column. |
| [data_type](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/datacolumn/data_type) | Type of the data in the data column. |
| [unit_type](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/datacolumn/unit_type) | Unit type of the data in the data column. |
| [currency](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/datacolumn/currency) | Currency ID of the data column. |
| [degree](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/datacolumn/degree) | Specifies the degree (power) of the units, for example squared, or cubed. The default (attribute absent) is 1. |
| [display_width](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/datacolumn/display_width) | Width of the data column in the External Data window. |
| [display_order](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/datacolumn/display_order) | Defines the display position of the data column in the External Data window, from the left-most column (0) to the right-most column (largest value). |
| [mapped](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/datacolumn/mapped) | Specifies whether the column is visible in the External Data window. True (1) for the column to be visible; false (0) for the column not to be visible. The default (attribute absent) is for the column to be visible. |
| [hyperlink](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/datacolumn/hyperlink) | Whether the data column creates a hyperlink in a shape when the shape is linked to data. |
