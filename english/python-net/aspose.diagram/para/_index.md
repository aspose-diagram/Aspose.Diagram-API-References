## Para class

Contains the paragraph formatting elements for the shape's text, such as indents, line spacing, bullets, and horizontal alignment of paragraphs.



The Para type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [Para()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/para/__init__/#) | Constructor. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [ix](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/para/ix) | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |
| [ind_first](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/para/ind_first) | Specifies the distance the first line of each paragraph in the shape's text block is indented from the left indent of the paragraph. This value is independent of the scale of the drawing. If the drawing is scaled, the first line indent remains the same. |
| [ind_left](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/para/ind_left) | Specifies the distance all lines of text in a paragraph are indented from the left margin of the text block. This value is independent of the scale of the drawing. If the drawing is scaled, the left indent remains the same. |
| [ind_right](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/para/ind_right) | Specifies the distance all lines of text in a paragraph are indented from the right margin of the text block. This value is independent of the scale of the drawing. If the drawing is scaled, the right indent remains the same. |
| [sp_line](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/para/sp_line) | Specifies the distance between one line of text and the next, where 100% is the height of a text line. |
| [sp_before](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/para/sp_before) | Specifies the amount of space inserted before each paragraph in the shape's text block. |
| [sp_after](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/para/sp_after) | Specifies the amount of space inserted after each paragraph in the shape's text block. |
| [horz_align](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/para/horz_align) | Specifies the horizontal alignment of text in the shape's text block. |
| [bullet](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/para/bullet) | Determines the bullet style. |
| [bullet_str](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/para/bullet_str) | "Used to create a custom bullet style. Enter the style as a string (within quotation marks). For example, you could enter the string, ""ooo.""" |
| [bullet_font](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/para/bullet_font) | Represents the number of the font used to format the text when a custom bullet string is specified and the value in the Bullet element is non-zero. |
| [localize_bullet_font](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/para/localize_bullet_font) | Specifies whether the bullet font should be localized (translated into another language). |
| [bullet_font_size](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/para/bullet_font_size) | Specifies the size of a bullet. |
| [text_pos_after_bullet](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/para/text_pos_after_bullet) | Represents the distance between the first line of the paragraph and the bullet. |
| [flags](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/para/flags) | Indicates whether the text direction is left to right or right to left. |


### Methods
