Contains elements for defining custom properties and elements for associating data with a shape.



The Prop type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [Prop()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/prop/__init__/#) | Constructor. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [value](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/prop/value) | Contains solution-specific, well-formed XML data that is prefixed in an explicit namespace and is stored with a document. |
| [name](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/prop/name) | The name of the element. |
| [name_u](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/prop/name_u) | The universal name of the element. |
| [ix](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/prop/ix) | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |
| [id](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/prop/id) | The unique ID of the element within its parent element. |
| [prompt](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/prop/prompt) | Prompt element specifies descriptive or instructional text that appears to users in the Custom Properties dialog box when the property is selected. This text also appears as a tool tip when the mouse pointer is paused over the property in the Custom Properties window. |
| [label](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/prop/label) | Specifies the label that appears to users in the Custom Properties dialog box. |
| [format](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/prop/format) | Format element specifies the formatting of a custom property that is a string, fixed list, number, variable list, date or time, duration, or currency. The custom property type is specified in the corresponding Type element. |
| [sort_key](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/prop/sort_key) | It specifies a key that determines the order in which custom properties are listed in the application's user interface. |
| [type](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/prop/type) | Type specifies a data type for the custom property value. |
| [invisible](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/prop/invisible) | Invisible element specifies whether the custom property is visible in the Custom Properties dialog box in Microsoft Visio. |
| [verify](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/prop/verify) | Specifies whether the user is queried to enter custom property information for a shape when an instance is created or the shape is duplicated or copied. |
| [lang_id](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/prop/lang_id) | Indicates the locale ID (LCID) of the language in which the cell formula, text, custom property, or comment was entered. |
| [calendar](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/prop/calendar) | Determines the calendar that is used for custom properties, text fields, and element formulas. |
