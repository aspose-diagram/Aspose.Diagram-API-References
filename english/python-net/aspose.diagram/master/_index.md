## Master class

Contains elements that define a master for the document. A master is a shape on a stencil that you use repeatedly to create drawings. When you drag a shape from a stencil onto the drawing page, the shape becomes an instance of that master, and a local copy of the master is included in the document.



The Master type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [Master()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/master/__init__/#) | Constructor. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [id](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/master/id) | The unique ID of the element within its parent element. |
| [base_id](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/master/base_id) | A GUID (globally unique identifier) that identifies the master across documents. |
| [unique_id](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/master/unique_id) | A GUID that identifies the master within the document. |
| [match_by_name](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/master/match_by_name) | The MatchByName attribute determines how Microsoft Visio decides if a document master is already present when an instance of a master is dropped on the drawing page. It allows changes made to a document master to apply to new instances of the master, even if the instances are dragged from a stand-alone stencil file. |
| [name](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/master/name) | The name of the element. |
| [name_u](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/master/name_u) | The universal name of the element. |
| [icon_size](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/master/icon_size) | The size of the element's icon. |
| [pattern_flags](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/master/pattern_flags) | The PatternFlags attribute determines whether a master behaves as a custom pattern. |
| [prompt](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/master/prompt) | The status bar and tool tip prompt for the element. |
| [hidden](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/master/hidden) | Specifies whether the master is hidden in the user interface. |
| [icon_update](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/master/icon_update) | Specifies whether the icon is automatically generated from the master itself. |
| [align_name](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/master/align_name) | Specifies whether the master's text in the stencil window is aligned left, right, or center. |
| [shapes](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/master/shapes) | Collection of Shape objects. |
| [connects](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/master/connects) | Contains a Connect element for each connection between two shapes in a drawing. |
| [icon](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/master/icon) | Specifies a MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) encoded binary icon (in .ico format) for a Master or MasterShortcut element in a document. |
| [page_sheet](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/master/page_sheet) | Contains elements that define the page sheet for a Page or Master element. |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [clone()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/master/clone/#) | Creates deep copy of this instance. |
