## Control class

Contains elements for the x- and y-coordinates of each control handle defined for a shape, and elements that specify the way the control handle should behave.



The Control type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [Control()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/control/__init__/#) | Constructor. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [name](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/control/name) | The name of the element. |
| [name_u](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/control/name_u) | The universal name of the element. |
| [id](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/control/id) | The unique ID of the element within its parent element. |
| [ix](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/control/ix) | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |
| [x](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/control/x) | The x-coordinate that indicates the location of a shape's control handle. |
| [y](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/control/y) | The y-coordinate that indicates the location of a shape's control handle. |
| [x_dyn](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/control/x_dyn) | Specifies the x-coordinate for a control handle's anchor point in local coordinates. The anchor point is used for rubber-banding during dynamics. |
| [y_dyn](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/control/y_dyn) | Specifies the y-coordinate for a control handle's anchor point in local coordinates. The anchor point is used for rubber-banding during dynamics. |
| [x_con](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/control/x_con) | Specifies the type of behavior the x-coordinate of the control handle exhibits after the handle is moved. |
| [y_con](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/control/y_con) | Specifies the type of behavior the x-coordinate of the control handle exhibits after the handle is moved. |
| [can_glue](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/control/can_glue) | Determines whether a control handle can be glued to other shapes. |
| [prompt](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/control/prompt) | Prompt element specifies descriptive text that appears as a tool tip when the mouse pointer is paused over a shape's control handle. |
