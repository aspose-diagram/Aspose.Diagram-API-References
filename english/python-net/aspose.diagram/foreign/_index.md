The Foreign type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [img_offset_x](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/foreign/img_offset_x) | Determines the distance the object is offset horizontally from the origin of the object's border. The default value is 0; the default formula is F="ImgWidth*0". |
| [img_offset_y](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/foreign/img_offset_y) | Determines the distance the object is offset vertically from the origin of the object's border. The default value is 0; the default formula is F="ImgHeight*0". |
| [img_width](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/foreign/img_width) | Determines the width of the object's image within its border. The default formula is: F="Width*1". |
| [img_height](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/foreign/img_height) | Determines the height of the object's image within its border. The default formula is: F="Height*1". |
