## Misc class

Contains various elements of shapes and groups, such as those that control selection highlighting and visibility.



The Misc type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [no_obj_handles](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/misc/no_obj_handles) | Specifies whether selection handles are displayed when the shape is selected. |
| [non_printing](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/misc/non_printing) | Specifies whether a selected shape can be printed. |
| [no_ctl_handles](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/misc/no_ctl_handles) | Specifies whether control handles are displayed when the shape is selected. |
| [no_align_box](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/misc/no_align_box) | Specifies whether the selection rectangle is displayed when the shape is selected. |
| [update_align_box](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/misc/update_align_box) | Specifies whether to recalculate a shape's selection rectangle whenever a control handle is moved. |
| [hide_text](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/misc/hide_text) | Hides the text for a shape. You can view text, edit properties, and apply styles to the text in the text block, although the changes will not appear until you specify the HideText element as 0. |
| [dyn_feedback](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/misc/dyn_feedback) | Specifies the type of visual feedback provided to users when they drag a connector |
| [glue_type](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/misc/glue_type) | Specifies whether dynamic (shape-to-shape) glue is allowed when connecting to a shape |
| [walk_preference](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/misc/walk_preference) | Specifies whether an endpoint of a 1-D shape moves to a horizontal or vertical connection point on the shape it is glued to, using dynamic glue, when the shape is moved to an ambiguous position. |
| [beg_trigger](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/misc/beg_trigger) | Contains a trigger formula generated by Microsoft Visio that determines whether to move the begin point of a 1-D shape to maintain its connection to another shape. |
| [end_trigger](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/misc/end_trigger) | Contains a trigger formula generated by Microsoft Visio. This trigger formula determines whether to move the end point of a 1-D shape to maintain its connection to another shape. |
| [obj_type](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/misc/obj_type) | Specifies whether objects are placeable or routable in diagrams when you use Microsoft Visio to lay out shapes on the drawing page. |
| [comment](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/misc/comment) | Contains the comment text in string format for a shape. |
| [is_drop_source](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/misc/is_drop_source) | Specifies whether the shape can be added to a group by dropping it onto the group |
| [is_replace_lock_shape_data](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/misc/is_replace_lock_shape_data) | Indicates whether the values of specified cells in a master shape overwrite the values (including local values) of a shape being replaced during a shape replacement operation. |
| [no_live_dynamics](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/misc/no_live_dynamics) | Specifies whether a shape dynamically resizes or rotates as the user manipulates it. |
| [localize_merge](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/misc/localize_merge) | Determines whether shapes are localized (whether their LangIDelement is reset) when they are copied between documents. |
| [calendar](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/misc/calendar) | Determines the calendar that is used for custom properties, text fields, and element formulas. |
| [lang_id](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/misc/lang_id) | Indicates the locale ID (LCID) of the language in which the cell formula, text, custom property, or comment was entered. |
| [shape_keywords](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/misc/shape_keywords) | Contains search keywords that have been assigned to custom master shapes. |
| [drop_on_page_scale](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/misc/drop_on_page_scale) | Determines the percentage by which a shape is scaled when it is dropped on the drawing page. |
