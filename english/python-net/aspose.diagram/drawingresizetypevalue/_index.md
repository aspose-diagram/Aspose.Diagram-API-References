## DrawingResizeTypeValue enumeration

Determines whether the drawing page resizes automatically to fit the diagram.



The DrawingResizeTypeValue type exposes the following members:

### Fields

| DEPENDS_ON_DRAWING_SIZE_TYPE | Whether the page resizes automatically depends on the value of the DrawingSizeType cell. If DrawingSizeType = 0 (the drawing page size is the same as the size of the printed page), the page resizes automatically. If the value of DrawingSizeType is anything other than zero (0), the page does not resize automatically. |
| AUTOMATICALLY | The drawing page resizes automatically. |
| NOT_AUTOMATICALLY | The drawing page does not resize automatically. |
| UNDEFINED | Undefined. |
