## ConValue enumeration

Specifies the type of behavior the x or y-coordinate of the control handle exhibits after the handle is moved.



The ConValue type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| PROPORTIONAL | Proportional. The control handle can be moved, and it also moves in proportion with the shape when it is stretched. |
| PROPORTIONAL_LOCKED | Proportional locked. The control handle moves in proportion with the shape, but the control handle itself cannot be moved. |
| OFFSET_FROM_LEFT_EDGE | Offset from left edge. The control handle is offset a constant distance from the left side of the shape. |
| OFFSET_FROM_CENTER | Offset from center. The control handle is offset a constant distance from the center of the shape. |
| OFFSET_FROM_RIGHT_EDGE | Offset from right edge. The control handle is offset a constant distance from the right side of the shape. |
| PROPORTIONAL_HIDDEN | Proportional, hidden.Same as 0, but the control handle is not visible. |
| PROPORTIONAL_LOCKED_HIDDEN | Proportional locked, hidden. Same as 1, but the control handle is not visible. |
| OFFSET_FROM_LEFT_EDGE_HIDDEN | Offset from left edge, hidden. Same as 2, but the control handle is not visible. |
| OFFSET_FROM_CENTER_HIDDEN | Offset from center, hidden. Same as 3, but the control handle is not visible. |
| OFFSET_FROM_RIGHT_EDGE_HIDDEN | Offset from right edge, hidden. Same as 4, but the control handle is not visible. |
| UNDEFINED | Undefined. |
