## Scratch class

Contains a work area for entering and testing formulas that are referred to by other elements. This element is typically used to isolate repeated complex calculations.



The Scratch type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [Scratch()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/scratch/__init__/#) | Constructor. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [ix](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/scratch/ix) | The zero-based index of the element within its parent element. |
| [a](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/scratch/a) | A general-purpose element. |
| [b](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/scratch/b) | A general-purpose scratch element. |
| [c](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/scratch/c) | A general-purpose element. |
| [d](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/scratch/d) | A general-purpose element. |
| [x](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/scratch/x) | Specifies an x-coordinate on a shape in local coordinates. The following table describes the X element based on the element that contains it. |
| [y](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/scratch/y) | Specifies a y-coordinate on a shape in local coordinates. Local coordinates are those whose frame of reference is the shape, instead of the page. |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [clone()](/diagram/python-net/aspose.diagram/scratch/clone/#) | Creates deep copy of this instance. |
