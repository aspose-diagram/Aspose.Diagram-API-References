## stencil_group property


Specifies the group of merged stencil windows of which the window is a member. This attribute is relevant only for Window elements whose WindowType attribute is Stencil, and only if the stencil window is part of a merged group of stencil windows. All stencil windows that are part of the same merged group have the same StencilGroup element value.
